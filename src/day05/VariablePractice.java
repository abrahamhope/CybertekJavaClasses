        whole numbers      : byte, short, int, double
        fractional numbers : float, double
        Logical            : boolean ( true, false)
        Character          : char (single character in single quote)

        String is not a primitive data type. String is sequence of characters.

        Usually, by default for whole number : just use int
        Usually, by default for fractional numbers: just use double
